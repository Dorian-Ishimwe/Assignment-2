    <p>EARLY LIFE : growing up, Gerald 'Jerry' Lawson grew up enjoying the many forms of science. his father was a physician, but due to the racial discrimination faced back then it wasn't possible for him to get a job. So Gerald grew up with science as a passion rather than an actual career, learning engineering and ham radios and using those skills to fix people's television sets. at 13 he would end up building his own ham radio in his room over the course of a couple of months. He would get the chance to go to 2 colleges in order to learn electronics, but he did not complete neither.
